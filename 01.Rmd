Reading books to stay awake: Qualitative predictors of public company performance

Keywords {NLP, annual report, industry analysis, 10-K}

Problem: The qualitative data in annual reports is costly and time consuming to review. The performance of public companies is largely considered in terms of the quantitative data in annual reports. The qualitative context that makes up the bulk of the report contains can contain revealing information about a company's operations. [@goel_sentiments_2016] However, this information is largely ignored and poured over only by industry-specific analysts. Analysts have spent thousands of hours working in the industry and spend countless additional hours parsing the text to update the view of the competitive landscape and make company specific recommendations.

The time required to interpret and compare reports is a problem for Wall Street firms that employ industry analysts. More broadly, because of the cost to create this information, it is too expensive and inaccessible for use cases beyond institutional investing. Lower cost to create could expand use cases to: executives and corporate strategy departments in mid-sized organizations, individual investors, feedback on investor relations performance (e.g. how did your description of company performance differ from peers?)  

Solution: Natural language processing(NLP) of annual reports in a specific industry may reduce the time it takes for analysts to assess the competitive landscape and a specific company’s response.

The application of NLP could support the following research questions: -What are the primary headwinds/tailwinds (or factors) impacting the industry? -For each company in the industry, how do they prioritize each factor? -For key factors, how does each company’s level of investment compare to their amount of qualitative coverage in their report?

If we take the telecommunications industry as an example, in a little over a year, assuming net neutrality is repealed, companies will be sharing their plans to address this change in the regulatory environment. It is likely to still be too early to see a difference in revenue, though there may be some changes in investment. The description of the opportunity that companies see in the space will be one of the best leading indicators for competitive changes in the industry. And NLP would allow for easy comparison of how much emphasis each firm is putting on the opportunity.

Impact: There is an opportunity to lower cost to produce industry research while improving quality and expanding access. The difference this solution could make starting with analysts is a dramatic reduction in the time it takes to consume new annual reports and update sector analysis. Further, the solution could provide insights that may not have been detected by reading, as the quantitative assessment of the text would not be colored by a legacy model of how the industry works. Beyond the wall street firms, CEOs and small corporate strategy departments and even investor relations team may benefit from access to illuminating research that would otherwise be inaccessible.
