Problem: The qualitative data in annual reports is costly and time consuming to review. The performance of public companies is largely considered in terms of the quantitative data in annual reports. The qualitative context that makes up the bulk of the report contains can contain revealing information about a company's operations. [@goel_sentiments_2016] However, this information is largely ignored and poured over only by industry-specific analysts at investment firms. Analysts have spent thousands of hours working in the industry and spend countless additional hours parsing the text to update the view of the competitive landscape and make company specific recommendations.

The time required to interpret and compare reports is a problem for Wall Street firms that employ industry analysts. More broadly, because of the cost to create this information, it is too expensive and inaccessible for use cases beyond institutional investing. From a practical perspective, individual investers and business leaders in small to medium-sized firms have limited access to this information.  

Solution: Natural language processing(NLP) of annual reports in a specific industry can create an insightful view of the competitive landscape and a specific company’s response.  The industry analysis would be made publically available.  The competitive comparison and company-specific reports would be available for a fee.  

The application of NLP could support the following research questions: 
-What are the primary headwinds/tailwinds (or factors) impacting the industry? 
-What is the sentiment surrounding key challenges and opportunities? 
-For each company in the industry, how do they prioritize each factor? 
-For key factors, how does each company’s level of investment compare to their amount of qualitative coverage in their report?

If we take the telecommunications industry as an example, in a little over a year, assuming net neutrality is repealed, companies will be sharing their plans to address this change in the regulatory environment. It is likely to still be too early to see a difference in revenue, though there may be some changes in investment. The description of the opportunity that companies see in the space will be one of the best leading indicators for competitive changes in the industry. And NLP would allow for easy comparison of how much emphasis each firm is putting on the opportunity.

Impact: There is an opportunity to synthesize qualitative insights from annual reports.  The difference this solution could make is to provide greater insight into industry trends to more investers and business leaders. Further, the solution could provide insights that may not have been detected by reading, as the quantitative assessment of the text would not be colored by a legacy model of how the industry works.  CEOs and small corporate strategy departments and even investor relations team may benefit from access to illuminating research that would otherwise be inaccessible.
