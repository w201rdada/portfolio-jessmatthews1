Figure .: Big Hello from Jess Abstract of speed reading Natural Language Processing can be used to quickly understand industry trends from annual reports. Annual reports are often hundreds of pages long and that information is rarely compared in a systematic way. That qualitative information can identify strategy changes before they show up in earnings reports. Abstract of sales prep dashboard This idea is based on the observation that B2B sales people who do back ground research to understand their customer’s business are more successful. Reducing the amount of time it takes sales people to do that research, but automating the prep can improve productivity and the quality of preparation. This idea begins to envision a tool to automate sales preparation to support the sale of research and advisory services to HR executives. About the author I am a product manager at Gartner based in San Francisco. I am originally from Pennsylvania where I received my BA and MA in Telecommunications Studies at Penn State. When not working or studying data science, I enjoy performing improv and seeing live music. Updated: 2018-03-15 "],

The qualitative data in annual reports is costly and time consuming to review. The performance of public companies is largely considered in terms of the quantitative data in annual reports. The qualitative context that makes up the bulk of the report contains can contain revealing information about a company’s operations. (Goel and Uzuner 2016) However, this information is largely ignored and poured over only by industry-specific analysts at investment firms. Analysts have spent thousands of hours working in the industry and spend countless additional hours parsing the text to update the view of the competitive landscape and make company specific recommendations. If we take the telecommunications industry as an example, in a little over a year, assuming net neutrality is repealed, companies will be sharing their plans to address this change in the regulatory environment. It is likely to still be too early to see a difference in revenue, though there may be some changes in investment. The description of the opportunity that companies see in the space will be one of the best leading indicators for competitive changes in the industry. And NLP would allow for easy comparison of how much emphasis each firm is putting on the opportunity. Interpreting and comparing reports is expensive and time consuming. GE’s 2016 Annual Report, for example, is 264 pages. Because of the cost to synthesize this information, it is too expensive and inaccessible for use cases beyond institutional investing. From a practical perspective, individual investers and business leaders in small to medium-sized firms have limited access to this information. For example, if I am the head of strategy at Gogo, a mid-sized telecom company focused on in-flight, internet and entertainment, I would want to have an informed hypothsis on how competitors will respond to rule changes and what that will mean for the experience customers will have when using Gogo’s product compared to other internet providers. I would not have the resources to review all of the reports in any detail. 1.2 Natural language processing can be used to summarize annual reports quickly. Natural language processing(NLP) of annual reports in a specific industry can create an insightful view of the competitive landscape and a specific company’s response. The industry analysis would be made publically available. The competitive comparison and company-specific reports would be available for a fee. The application of NLP could support the following research questions: -What are the primary headwinds/tailwinds (or factors) impacting the industry? -What is the sentiment surrounding key challenges and opportunities? -For each company in the industry, how do they prioritize each factor? -For key factors, how does each company’s level of investment compare to their amount of qualitative coverage in their report? Development of the solution would include comparing supervised and unsupervised learning models. Supervised learning models will rely on experts to align text to specific factors. These factors will create a strong backbone for summarizing company comparisons. Unsupervised learning models can help identify unforeseen factors, changes in the environment and unexpected topics to eventually be added to the supervised model. 1.3 A powerful summary of competitive trends can inform strategy decisions: Continuing our hypothetical example, the head of corporate strategy and CEO at Gogo are planning to facilitate a conversation with business leaders on the degree to which their product should change due to the repeal of net neutrality. Because in-flight consumers naturally compare their experience with in home use, understanding competitive changes in the user experience is particularly important. Using an NLP-powered competitive report, they share a stack rank of the extent to which competitors are likely to change their internet offerings. This visual allows the conversation to focus on what is the right degree of change for their business to take on, rather than debating what folks believe may change. This is a level of insight that was previously not available to this team. Bibliography "],

Gartner for HR leaders is a subscription-based advisory service that provides data, insights, and access to experts that save executives time and help them make better decisions. This new product is designed to support the mission critical priorities of HR leaders. The people who are most successful at selling the product are those who are able to connect the HR leader’s priorities to broader cooperate objectives. Because these priorities are so critical to the company and the executive’s success, they are connected to executive attention and budget. Our most successful sales people spend more of their time researching companies to effectively identify these priorities and tailor their conversations to client interests. They use seeking alpha, set google news alerts, and pull information from multiple internal sources, including our CRM. While this background research is critical, steam-lining it can save the sales team significant time and improve the quality of call prep. diagram_for_rdada 2.2 A sales prep dashboard can reduce the amount of time sales representatives need to research their prospects and actually improve the quality of information that they gather. The more that our commercial team understands what is valuable to their prospects the more effective they can be articulating the value of our product. This requires three types of information: company-, HR-, and personally-specific context. -Company: We create queries to pull from APIs (potentially Hoovers or Seeking Alpha) to receive an overview of what the company does in natural language, how they make money, and the top trends in their industry. This allows the sales executive to create a hypothesis on how the corporate objectives for the company connect to the priorities of the executive. “For example, I noticed that your company has a 10% growth target this year. How does that impact your annual objectives as the head of recruiting?” -HR: We use natural language processing (NLP) to scan annual reports for key HR terms, such as “talent management”. We create queries to pull from our proprietary talent analytics tools to show the job titles that will be hardest to recruit for. For example, “We hear from other industrial mining companies that filling mineral engineering roles is becoming more challenging. What are your most challenging talent segments?” -Personal: We pull from LinkedIn and other company websites, how long the person has been in seat and how many years of experience they have. We use this data in to place prospects in a one of a few types of user profiles for getting personal value from the product. For example, “When we work with Heads of HR that are new to an organization but tenured in their career, we usually partner with them on driving execution in their team to solve one or two key challenges. We recently worked with the direct reports of the CHRO at a mid-sized bank to complete their succession management program and update their performance management processes to quarterly reviews.” Too much information will limit the effectiveness of the tool. In order to limit the amount of information that is gathered in each category, we start by reviewing the prep and calls of the top sales people. We will get input on what information is most valuable for sales people and include information in the dashboard only if it is helpful to sales team’s in understanding the company such that they prepare for the call differently or if the information is used during their sales conversation. For company, HR, and personal information, each area will be pulled together manually and tested with commercial partners before building out the functionality. We will then test each area before moving on the next. This will avoid building an over featured, but unworkable tool. Results are displayed in a prospect specific dashboard. 2.3 A sales prep dashboard can elevate the effectiveness of the sales team while saving time for the most productive sales people. If a sales executive supports 20 calls on average a month and spends 90 minutes preparing for each call, the prep dashboard could save 30 hours/sales person per month or more than 200 hours of prep time per sales person per year. That creates the opportunity for our most successful sales reps to have an additional 100+ sales interactions. For sales reps with less experience, they will learn more quickly how to use research on their calls by having an effective information at their finger tips, dramatically reducing on-boarding time. Challenges to executing this project include: managing data dependencies around accessing LinkedIn-like data, the cost to acquire data from third party vendors, the availability of personal profiles especially in emerging markets, and the need to build and test the models for personal value. While these challenges are real, the potential payoff in sales force productivity is significant. Iterative testing for practical value will help to manage some of these risks. "],
