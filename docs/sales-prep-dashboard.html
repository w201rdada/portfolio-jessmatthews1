<p>Gartner for HR leaders is a subscription-based advisory service that provides data, insights, and access to experts that save executives time and help them make better decisions. This new product is designed to support the mission critical priorities of HR leaders. The people who are most successful at selling the product are those who are able to connect the HR leader’s priorities to broader cooperate objectives. Because these priorities are so critical to the company and the executive’s success, they are connected to executive attention and budget. Our most successful sales people spend more of their time researching companies to effectively identify these priorities and tailor their conversations to client interests. They use seeking alpha, set google news alerts, and pull information from multiple internal sources, including our CRM. While this background research is critical, steam-lining it can save the sales team significant time and improve the quality of call prep.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> A sales prep dashboard can reduce the amount of time sales representatives need to research their prospects and actually improve the quality of information that they gather.</h2>
<p>The more that our commercial team understands what is valuable to their prospects the more effective they can be articulating the value of our product. This requires three types of information: company-, HR-, and personally-specific context.</p>
<p>-Company: We create queries to pull from APIs (potentially Hoovers or Seeking Alpha) to receive an overview of what the company does in natural language, how they make money, and the top trends in their industry. This allows the sales executive to create a hypothesis on how the corporate objectives for the company connect to the priorities of the executive. “For example, I noticed that your company has a 10% growth target this year. How does that impact your annual objectives as the head of recruiting?”</p>
<p>-HR: We use natural language processing (NLP) to scan annual reports for key HR terms, such as “talent management”. We create queries to pull from our proprietary talent analytics tools to show the job titles that will be hardest to recruit for. For example, “We hear from other industrial mining companies that filling mineral engineering roles is becoming more challenging. What are your most challenging talent segments?”</p>
<p>-Personal: We pull from LinkedIn and other company websites, how long the person has been in seat and how many years of experience they have. We use this data in to place prospects in a one of a few types of user profiles for getting personal value from the product. For example, “When we work with Heads of HR that are new to an organization but tenured in their career, we usually partner with them on driving execution in their team to solve one or two key challenges. We recently worked with the direct reports of the CHRO at a mid-sized bank to complete their succession management program and update their performance management processes to quarterly reviews.”</p>
<p>Too much information will limit the effectiveness of the tool. In order to limit the amount of information that is gathered in each category, we start by reviewing the prep and calls of the top sales people. We will get input on what information is most valuable for sales people and include information in the dashboard only if it is helpful to sales team’s in understanding the company such that they prepare for the call differently or if the information is used during their sales conversation.</p>
<p>For company, HR, and personal information, each area will be pulled together manually and tested with commercial partners before building out the functionality. We will then test each area before moving on the next. This will avoid building an over featured, but unworkable tool. Results are displayed in a prospect specific dashboard.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> A sales prep dashboard can elevate the effectiveness of the sales team while saving time for the most productive sales people.</h2>
<p>If a sales executive supports 20 calls on average a month and spends 90 minutes preparing for each call, the prep dashboard could save 30 hours/sales person per month or more than 200 hours of prep time per sales person per year. That creates the opportunity for our most successful sales reps to have an additional 100+ sales interactions. For sales reps with less experience, they will learn more quickly how to use research on their calls by having an effective information at their finger tips, dramatically reducing on-boarding time.</p>
<p>Challenges to executing this project include: managing data dependencies around accessing LinkedIn-like data, the cost to acquire data from third party vendors, the availability of personal profiles especially in emerging markets, and the need to build and test the models for personal value. While these challenges are real, the potential payoff in sales force productivity is significant. Iterative testing for practical value will help to manage some of these risks.</p>
