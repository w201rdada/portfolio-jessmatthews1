### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

Natural Language Processing can be used to quickly understand industry trends from annual reports.  
Annual reports are often hundreds of pages long and that information 
is rarely compared in a systematic way.  That qualitative information can identify strategy changes before they show up in earnings reports.

### Abstract of my second cool idea {-}

This idea is based on the observation that B2B sales people who do back ground research to understand their customer's business are more successful.  Reducing the amount of time it takes sales people to do that research, but automating the prep can improve productivity and the quality of preparation.  This idea begins to envision a tool to automate sales preparation to support the sale of research and advisory services to HR executives.
